## Validator Support Communities
There is no setup help or support officially provided to validators by the blockchains you are your own help desk. It's always best to fully learn your system before going live on a blockchain. If you do get stuck you can always ask for help in:
- [Harmony's Official Discord Server](https://harmony.one/discord) is the best spot for all things Harmony first for fastest response.
- [Harmony Official Mainnet Staking Telegram Channel](https://t.me/PangaeaVolunteers) is another great spot for Harmony questions.
- [EasyNodePro.com Discord](https://mee6.xyz/i/TvaDiyZ9hc) - We do field questions in our Discord server but we may take our sweet time to respond. Other users may provide assistance if they're available so post in the proper channels!
