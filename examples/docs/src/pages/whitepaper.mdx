# ENP Token White Paper

Whitepaper Version 1.1.1 - January 24, 2025

## Introduction

The ENP token is a utility token designed to incentivize and reward users for staking with our [EasyNode.pro](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet/one18julyys26h67r4vq3zexzpfmvt9vpn0g75phmu) & [RockTheBlockchain](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet/one1p2rmvndevvw682qynqu08hyvx24hh4runsw6pz) validator pools on the Harmony blockchain. By providing a unique token-based reward system, we aim to create a more engaging and profitable experience for our users while also promoting the growth and adoption of the Harmony ecosystem.

## Token Overview

- **Token Name:** ENP (EasyNode.pro)
- **Token Symbol:** ENP
- **Total Supply:** 500,000,000 ENP
- **Token Type:** ERC-20
- **Blockchain:** Harmony

## Token Distribution

The ENP token has been distributed as follows:

- **Air Drops:** 30% of the total supply (150,000,000 ENP) will be air dropped to users who stake with our EasyNode.pro & RockTheBlockchain validator pools, proportional to their stake weight.
- **Liquidity Pool:** 15% of the total supply (75,000,000 ENP) is allocated to liquidity pools on a decentralized exchange (DEX), paired with Harmony's ONE, uONE, and MONA on Harmony Protocol.
- **Team Allocation:** 5% of the total supply (25,000,000 ENP) is allocated to the team as hot tokens to help keep ENP active and engaged.
- **Remaining Tokens:** 50% of the total supply (250,000,000 ENP) is reserved for future development, partnerships, and other purposes.

## Token Utility

The ENP token will have the following utilities:

- **Staking Rewards:** ENP tokens will be distributed as rewards to users who stake with our validator pools EasyNode.pro & RockTheBlockchain, in addition to the standard ONE rewards.
- **Liquidity Provision:** ENP tokens were used to provide liquidity on [swap.harmony.one DEX](swap.harmony.one), paired with ONE, uONE, and MONA to create a stable and liquid market.
- **Token Burning:** A portion of the ENP tokens will be burned periodically, using the ONE rewards earned by our validator pool, to reduce the total supply and increase the token's value.
- **Governance:** ENP token holders will have voting rights on proposals for the development and growth of our validator pool and the Harmony ecosystem.

## Tokenomics

The ENP token's value will be driven by the following factors:

- **Staking Demand:** The demand for ENP tokens will increase as more users stake with our validator pool, driving up the token's value.
- **Liquidity:** The liquidity pool will provide a stable source of buy and sell pressure, maintaining a stable market price.
- **Token Burning:** The periodic burning of ENP tokens will reduce the total supply, increasing the token's value over time.
- **Adoption:** As the Harmony ecosystem grows, the demand for ENP tokens will increase, driving up the token's value.

## Validator Pool Integration

Our validator pools, EasyNode.pro & RockTheBlockchain, will be integrated with the ENP token as follows:

- **Staking Rewards:** Users who stake with our validator pools will receive ENP tokens as rewards, in addition to the standard ONE rewards.
- **Weighted Distribution:** ENP tokens will be distributed to users based on their stake weight, ensuring that larger stakeholders receive a proportionally larger share of the rewards.
- **Reward Schedule:** ENP tokens will be distributed on a regular schedule, ensuring that users receive their rewards in a timely and predictable manner.

## Liquidity Pool Strategy

Our liquidity pool strategy will involve the following:
- **Initial Liquidity:** We started 2 LP funds with the following allocations:
  - 55 million ENP / 34,000 ONE
  - 20 million ENP / 1.6 billion MONA
  - Approximately 75 million ENP has been allocated to LP pools to start.
- **Future Liquidity:** We currently plan to accumulate a top level stable coin for deployment of a stable/$ENP pool in Q2 2025.
- **ONE Rewards:** We will use the ONE rewards earned by our validator pool to buy ENP tokens on the market. Those tokens will be used for LP, burned or reserved for future air drops.

## Air Drop Strategy

### Initial Air Drop

- 10 million ENP was air dropped to EasyNode.pro Validator delegators.
- 20 million ENP was air dropped to RockTheBlockchain Validator delegators.
- 2 million ENP was air dropped to each of the following validator delegators: Farmony, Harmony Hub, and Deadpool.

### Future Air Drops

Future air drops will only go to EasyNode.pro and RockTheBlockchain delegators. Users are encouraged to migrate to these validators to receive future air drops.  

### Locked Tokens

- A total of 36 million ENP has been air dropped so far
- A total of 72 million ENP is locked, releasing 3 million monthly to be air dropped over the next 24 months, through January 2027!
- A total of 42 million ENP is locked, releasing 1,166,667 monthly starting January 2026, usage TBD but either added to airdrops, for additional airdrops, liquidity buying, or burning purposes.
- A total of 150 million ENP is locked, releasing 50 million monthly starting January 2026, usage for marketing, promos, parternships and other opportinities. If it goes unused it will be burned.
