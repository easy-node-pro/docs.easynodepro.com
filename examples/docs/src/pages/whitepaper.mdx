# ENP Token White Paper

Whitepaper Version 1.1.1 - January 24, 2025

## Introduction

The ENP token is a utility token designed to incentivize and reward users for staking with our [EasyNode.pro](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet/one18julyys26h67r4vq3zexzpfmvt9vpn0g75phmu) & [RockTheBlockchain](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet/one1p2rmvndevvw682qynqu08hyvx24hh4runsw6pz) validator pools on the Harmony blockchain. By providing a unique token-based reward system, we aim to create a more engaging and profitable experience for our users while promoting the growth and adoption of the Harmony ecosystem.

## Token Distribution

The ENP token has been distributed as follows:

- **Air Drops:**
  - 7.2% (36 million `$ENP`) was airdropped to delegators of EasyNode.pro, RockTheBlockchain, Deadpool, Harmony Hub, and Farmony around December 30th, 2024 as a thank you for staking in 2024.
  - 14.4% (72 million `$ENP`) is locked with 3m unlocking monthly starting Feb. 1st, 2025 for 2 years. These will be airdropped to EasyNode.pro and RockTheBlockchain delegators on the first of each month.
  - 8.4% (42 million `$ENP`) is locked with ~1.16m unlocking monthly starting January 1st, 2026 for 2 years. These will be added to airdrops, burned, used to increase LP, or other purposes TBD.
- **Liquidity Pool:** 
  - 15% of the total supply (75,000,000 ENP) was funded to the initial liquidity pools on [swap.harmony.one DEX](swap.harmony.one) paired with `$ONE` and `$MONA`.

## Token Utility

The ENP token has the following utilities:

- **Staking Rewards:** ENP tokens will be distributed as rewards to users who stake with our validator pools EasyNode.pro & RockTheBlockchain, in addition to the standard ONE rewards.
- **Liquidity Provision:** ENP tokens were used to provide liquidity on [swap.harmony.one DEX](swap.harmony.one), paired with ONE and MONA to create a stable and liquid market.
- **Token Burning:** A portion of the ENP tokens will be burned periodically using the ONE rewards earned by our validator pool, to reduce the total supply and increase the token's value.
- **Governance:** ENP token holders will have voting rights on proposals for the development and growth of our validator pool and the Harmony ecosystem.

## Tokenomics

The ENP token's value will be driven by the following factors:

- **Validator Rewards:** We will use a % of our monthly rewards to buy, burn, hold, grow LP, and more with `$ENP` & paired coins.
- **Staking Demand:** The demand for ENP tokens will increase as more users stake with our validator pool, driving up the token's value.
- **Liquidity:** The liquidity pool will provide a stable source of buy and sell pressure, maintaining a stable market price.
- **Token Burning:** The periodic burning of ENP tokens will reduce the total supply, increasing the token's value over time.
- **Adoption:** As the Harmony ecosystem grows, the demand for ENP tokens will increase, driving up the token's value.

## Validator Pool Integration

Our validator pools, EasyNode.pro & RockTheBlockchain, will be integrated with the ENP token as follows:

- **Staking Rewards:** Users who stake with our validator pools will receive ENP tokens as rewards, in addition to the standard ONE rewards.
- **Weighted Distribution:** ENP tokens will be distributed to users based on their stake weight, ensuring that larger stakeholders receive a proportionally larger share of the rewards.
- **Reward Schedule:** ENP tokens will be distributed on the first of each month through January 2027. Beyond that, schedule & allocation TBD.

## Air Drop Strategy

### Initial Air Drop

- 10 million ENP was airdropped to EasyNode.pro Validator delegators.
- 20 million ENP was airdropped to RockTheBlockchain Validator delegators.
- 2 million ENP was airdropped to each of the following validator delegators: Farmony, Harmony Hub, and Deadpool.

### Future Air Drops

3 million `$ENP` will be airdropped on the first of each month from Feb 1st, 2025 - Jan 1st, 2027. These airdrops will only go to EasyNode.pro and RockTheBlockchain delegators by stake weight. Users are encouraged to migrate to these validators to receive future airdrops.

## Burned `$ENP`

- **Token Burn:** We currently buy and burn as we spend validator rewards. We will determine if there is a burn schedule along with the monthly airdrops soon.
- **Total Burn:** We have burned **2,000,000 `$ENP`** as of 1/21/2025.
